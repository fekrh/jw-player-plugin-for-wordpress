This module is provided by LongTail Video Inc.  It enables you to configure and embed the JW Player for Flash for use on your WordPress website.

== Description ==

The JW Player Plugin for WordPress makes it extremely easy to deliver video through your WordPress website. This plugin has been developed by LongTail Video, the creator of the JW Player, and allows for easy customization and embedding of the JW Player in your WordPress posts. It provides support for all of the player's configuration options, including skins, plugins and the LongTail Video AdSolution.

In addition, it supports a powerful tag system that allows for dynamic customization at embed time, and gives you the capability of referencing external video content.  Plus, if your users are viewing your site on an iDevice, it will embed the &lt;video&gt; tag instead.  Allowing your users to experience your video content from anywhere.

This plugin also expands the built in WordPress Media Library.  You can now add media files from a URL (including full support for YouTube videos and RTMP streams).  It is also really simple to create custom playlists using the built in Playlist Manager.
